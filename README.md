This repository contains the frontend code for the GeneFoundry landing page.

## Project Overview

GeneFoundry is a modular registry designed to provide trustworthy, evidence-based genomic analysis powered by Model Context Protocols (MCPs). It aims to solve the "hallucination" problem in AI by grounding outputs in validated, standardized data retrieval.

## Current Status

**Note:** This application serves as the **conceptual entry page** for the GeneFoundry Proof of Concept (POC). It demonstrates the vision, methodology, and user perspectives but is currently a standalone presentation layer.
